01. Memory leak

When each object is allocated some memory & when that memory is not de-allocated, memory leaks occurs.
This cause, poor app performance & crashes.

Detect memory leaks
Google Console, Crashes with  OutOfMemoryException, LeakCanery

Avoid Memory leaks
Mostly take care about context
Avoid inner classes, static context

02. The 3 Oâ€™s of RxJava Core

RxJava is a library for composing asynchronous streams of real-time data and event-based programs
by using observable sequences in a Reactive Programming style.

Observable - emits items ( stream )
Observer - consumes those items
Operator - Emissions from Observable objects can further be modified, transformed, and manipulated by chaining Operator calls.

03. Benefits of using RxJava

Solves the problem of call-back hell.
Easy threading
Multiple operator makes it highly flexible
Easy error handling
